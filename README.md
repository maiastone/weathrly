##weathrly   

A simple weather forecast application, built using:

* ReactJS
* jQuery for AJAX only (No DOM manipulation)
* Sass
* API

The application has a welcome page, and the user can a desired city.  A seven day forecast, with a daily hourly breakdown is shown.  A text summary for the day is rendered, as well as an extreme weather alert.  An image is rendered based on the weather average for the day.

*Note - As a first introduction to both React and using API data, we used API data
developed specifically for this project and including the cities of:*    
* Castle Rock   
* Denver   
* San Diego   
* San Francisco
